The **Cyberinfrastructure Training for Electron Microscopy–Enabled
Materials Science (CITEAM)** project brings together PIs with
expertise in CI as well as in imaging-enabled materials science to
develop an innovative training program targeting the materials science
community that relies on advanced microscopes (e.g., Transmission
Electron Microscopes (TEM)) for research.
