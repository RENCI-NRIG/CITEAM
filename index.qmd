The **Cyberinfrastructure Training for Electron Microscopy–Enabled
Materials Science (CITEAM)** project brings together PIs with
expertise in CI as well as in imaging-enabled materials science to
develop an innovative training program targeting the materials science
community that relies on advanced microscopes (e.g., Transmission
Electron Microscopes (TEM)) for research.

The training program covers several relevant thematic areas – TEM
instrument software, image analysis, scientific computing, application
of AI in TEM image and data analysis, diffraction and spectroscopy
data analysis, distributed computing for EM data processing, data
curation and FAIR principles.

CITEAM includes an additional element of “training the trainers” by
exposing the relevant CI contributors – the research facilitators and
laboratory staff scientists – to advanced CI topics, empowering them
to guide others and innovate in the use of CI for materials science.

Training is offered in multiple modalities: self-paced modules, video
lectures, templates and catalogs, office hours, sessions at the annual
**CITEAM Users’ Workshop**, and tutorials at domain science
conferences.

CITEAM also devotes a significant effort to community building through
a **three-pronged coordination network** comprising imaging
laboratories, domain science communities, and experts from national CI
resource providers. This approach ensures scalability, sustainability,
and broad dissemination of training materials and practices.


There are presently two sets of training modules available. The first
one is a basic introduction to the Python programming language. Python
has quickly become the dominant language for science and engineering,
and all our remaining modules will use it. The second module is an
introduction to electron microscope image processing and is, of
course, written in Python.
